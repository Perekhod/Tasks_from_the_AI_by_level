# This repository contains the tasks that the neural network generated for me.It is clear that it took them from different internet sources,
# but for practice it is the best. The tasks are divided into 20 levels, the levels were invented by the neural network itself,
# so I can't say how it graded them. In any case, it is good practice. Solve the exercises and if you don't succeed, you can see my solution. Good luck!
